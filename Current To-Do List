#CURRENT TO-DO LIST
(put name in brackets beside it if you wanna claim it or move it to finished tasks if completed)
  

Finished Tasks:

- Fix Storyboard! (make into one cohesive story path) from what is in the slack

- Add to the UI:
      Profile
      Inventory
      main Search screen(users, skills, offers, requests)
      
Release Planning

For each use case (DIVIDED IN THE GOOGLE DOC SHARED IN EMAIL AND ON SLACK):
  - do the google doc we started with content like on slides 35-39 of here:

-Glossary (may need updating as we go): (FALON CAN FIX THIS UP AND MAKE IT COMPLETE)
    The glossary entries should specify sources that are relevant to the domain of your application. 
    For example, your definition of "user" should come from some external source, 
    such as a reference (e.g. a dictionary) or well-known technology (e.g. amazon.com) 
    that defines the term and that external source should not be discussing drug users,
    because that would be irrelevant to the domain of your app.
    
-Finish the use cases in the wiki list and pick who wants which ones (see google doc for labour split)
 
-license our code (hindle recommended to me(Falon) to use GPL3: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html)
        **Make sure the license header is in every java file we have
        
 *** DO THIS AFTER USE CASES AND TRY AND FORMAT FORMAT ALREADY STARTED WITH TEST CASES
  - write up the mock junit tests (the one's that aren't finished already)
        "It should show the intent of the code to implement the use case. 
        Test values, smoke tests are not enough."
