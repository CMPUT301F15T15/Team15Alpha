/**~~DESCRIPTION:
 * We have a trade list as one of the core features within our application. Users in our application
 * are all going to (ideally) have the goal in which case they want to trade skills with one another
 * this list is going to be THE focus of the class/object that facilitates this entire process
 * of trading with other users!
 *
 *
 * ~~CONSTRUCTORS:
 * We have a public constructor that means that it is avaliable to all other classes/the rest
 * of the application to be created. In particular however this will be most tied to the
 * class of objects which is the users objects.
 *
 * This constructor is going to take the parameters of the userID and then it will assign
 * the owner of this object to the id attribute and then it will assign the trades attribute
 * with an arraylist of trade objects! The trade objects are unique dedicated objects, this
 * trade list is what strings them together in a very gentle fashion that is easier to
 * interact with.
 *
 *
 * ~~ATTRIBUTES/METHODS:
 * 1: USERID:
 *     This is going to be a private attribute that will be a UserID object, this USerID object
 *     is a numerical value that uniquely identfies the user and seperates them from all other
 *     users, in a database sense this actually will act as a key! :)
 *
 *     WE PROVIDE THE METHODS TO:
 *         -Nothing, this is only set during the constructor of this object.
 *
 *
 * 2: TRADES:
 *     This is going to be a list of trades, this is going to be where the entire string of
 *     various trade singlet objects will be stringed together into a coherent whole where the
 *     application can more easily utilize this trade list for the rest of the application
 *     from this point onwards.
 *
 *     WE PROVIDE THE METHODS TO:
 *         -delete a trade, where we delete a trade from the entire list of potential
 *         trades associated with the user.                     --delete
 *
 *         -create a brand new trade in the list of the trades for this particular user
 *         and store it in the list.                            --createTrade
 *
 *         -obtain the list of all of the most recently active tradeS (PLURAL) in which case
 *         the trades will be compared based upon time.         --getActiveTrades
 *
 *
 *         -obtain the list of all of the most recently active trade (SINGULAR) in which case
 *         the trades will be compared based upon time.         --getMostRecentTrade
 *
