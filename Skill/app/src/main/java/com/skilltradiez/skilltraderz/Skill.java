/**
 * ~~DESCRIPTION:
 * A skill represents something that a person can do. In this application we have skills as the
 * primary element surrounding the entire purpose of why a user would want to obtain this app.
 * Therefore it is critical that we store details on that particular skill in an easy to access,
 * easy to modify, easy to store and easy to retrieve way. However this class when instantiated
 * will provide us with an object (for a particular skill) with all possible desirable features.
 * <p/>
 * Implementation wise, a skill is a large set of attributes bundled together in a reasonable
 * (assumedly) fashion. We maintain proper encapsulation of these details through making these
 * attributes all private and giving getter/setter methods (very traditional).
 * <p/>
 * ~~ACCESS:
 * This class is public, allowing new instances to be instantiated outside of the program
 * by any other class. Further to the point, the constructors are public access; anything else
 * in this application may create a skill object.
 * <p/>
 * ~~CONSTRUCTORS:
 * This class has two constructors, in particular we are making use of constructor method
 * overloading. Meaning that the same method name to call the constructor is used to access
 * two different constructors.
 * <p/>
 * 1: The first constructor may be called with ONLY a name for the skill object to be created.
 * Likewise we will fashion the newly instantiated object with a plethora of defaults.:
 * -Category = Misc., by default we'll throw it into the Misc. category.
 * -Visibility = True (any user may see this object)
 * -Description = an empty string (Literally "").
 * -Image = a null image object, however we should damn well put a default here.
 * <p/>
 * In this constructor the only thing specified is the name of the skill.
 * <p/>
 * 2: The second constructor is activated (METHOD OVERLOADING) when provided with a string
 * representing the name of the skill AND a category string.
 * Defaults are created upon construction as follows:
 * -Visibility = True (any user may see this object)
 * -Description = an empty string (Literally "").
 * -Image = a null image object, however we should damn well put a default here.
 * <p/>
 * In this constructor the two things specified, skill name AND the skill category are maintained
 * by the object.
 * <p/>
 * ~~ATTRIBUTES/METHODS:
 * Note, all methods in this class are directly related to the attributes present in this object.
 * Therefore I will describe them paired together in an ordered fashion.
 * <p/>
 * 1: NAME.
 * This will be what the user inputs as the name of the skill. This is completely
 * arbitrary and up to the user to put in. Eg: If they wanted to call their skill
 * "master of hungry-hungry hippos" they by all means may do that. The database would accept it.
 * <p/>
 * WE PROVIDE THE METHODS TO:
 * -Get the name of the skill.  --getName
 * -Set the name of the skill.  --setName
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * 2: CATEGORY.
 * This is going to be what the user selects their skill falls under. Think about this as a more
 * rigid structure that the user does NOT get to arbitrarily choose. This is HARD CODED into
 * the application itself. This is given a unique identifier that the database also maintains
 * that gives it a unique grouping.
 * Eg: A user may NAME a skill "Cat bathing master of awesome" but they MUST choose between
 * our predefined hard coded categories. In this instance let's say we have a "Pets" category.
 * The user will choose their own defined skill to be within our defined "Pets" category!
 * WE PROVIDE THE METHODS TO:
 * -Get the name of the category        --getCategory
 * -Set the name of the category        --setCategory
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * 3: IMAGE.
 * What is life without images? It is terrible.
 * But more to the point, we will allow users to select and upload an image that is related to
 * their skill. This image is going to actually be shoved into the database itself. We will
 * of course provide some (admittedly hideous) default image if this is left blank, but we
 * give the user an option to provide us with an image.
 * WE PROVIDE THE METHODS TO:
 * -Get the image                       --getImage
 * -Set the image                       --setImage
 * -Delete the image! (Just incase!)    --deleteImage
 * <p/>
 * 4: VISIBLE.
 * This is going to be a user option where they can either set their skill to be VISIBLE on
 * their page or to NOT be VISIBLE on their page. This allows the user to either reveal or
 * to hide their skill.
 * WE PROVIDE THE METHODS TO:
 * -Get the current visibility of the skill  --isVisibile (***NOTE: NOT GET VISIBILITY!)
 * -Set the current visibility of the skill  --setVisibility
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * 5: DESCRIPTION.
 * The user has a set of skills. But what exactly seperates this user's "Cat Olympics" skill
 * vs. Mary-Jane-Sue-The-VIII's "Cat Olympics" skill? Why, of course, the description! This
 * is going to be a private string dedicated to letting the user fill out details of their
 * particular brand of (just an example) "Cat Olympics". Maybe Mary-Jane-Sue-The-VIII has
 * successfully trained 8 cats that won gold... this would be a perfect thing to put in
 * the description! You go Mary-Jane-Sue-The-VIII, you go girl!
 * WE PROVIDE THE METHODS TO:
 * -Get the description         --getDescription
 * -Set the description         --setDescription
