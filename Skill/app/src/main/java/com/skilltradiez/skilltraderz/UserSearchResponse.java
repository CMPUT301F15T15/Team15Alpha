/**
 * When a user is going to utilize a search we are going to want to have some sort
 * of reply back to the application, this class is purely dedicated to achieving the amount of
 * total, successful and failed attempts.
 *
 * This is tightly bound to the elastic search class. But there is a twist, this may be a
 * class called UserSearchResponse-- but it has two miniature classes located within itself. This
 * is going to be the Hits and hit class-- these are going to be useful in picking apart particular
 * returns from the elasticsearch database as the user searches.
 *
 * This can be useful in telling us how many times the search was done, whether it worked or failed.
