/**~~DESCRIPTION:
 * This is going to be the class where we have the inventory and all of it's associated functions
 * that a user will have all clumped together into one coherent object.
 * This object will have a set of attributes that are related to the inventory such as an
 * arraylist of skills. (And that's it.... for now... dun dun dunnnnn!)
 * This object will be method centric, where most of the object will be dealing with manipulating
 * a truckload of functionality throughout the rest of the objects present within the application.
 *
 * ~~ACCESS:
 * This is a public class, meaning that any other class or part of the application can call,
 * instantiate, and utilize the methods associated
 *
 * ~~CONSTRUCTOR:
 *
 * This class is going to only have one constructor associated with it. This constructor will take
 * in no parameters and will simply instantiate a new instance of this class and then within
 * this object it will instantiate a new ArrayList if ID's. This allows this to have a
 * unique collection of things.
 *
 *
 * ~~ATTRIBUTES/METHODS:
 * 1: SKILLZ:
 *     We want an inventory to be populated with a ton of ID's that are going to represent various
 *     skillZ that the user has. Without this we couldn't possibly piece together what a user
 *     actually has to offer/can offer to someone else. AND SO.... we make this lovely arraylist
 *     and pop values of ID's into there and this also has the function of allowing us to have
 *     a unique PRIMARY KEY ESQUE way of accessing the database. It is glorious, it is fun, it is
 *     great. Enjoy!
 *
 * ~~MISC METHODS:
 *     Let me state here that the only reason I am putting the things here is because it will
 *     get hella convoluted if I try and maintain the exact rigid format as before.
 *
 *  1: GET:
 *      THIS IS AN OVERLOADED METHOD! OVERLOADED METHOD!
 *      Meaning that depending on the parameters given to this particular function we will
 *      have the function do a dramatically different function!
 *
 *      OVERLOADED ONE:
 *          PARAMETERS:   UserDatabase userDB, Integer index
 *          This is going to be given a userdatabase, and then an index value. This is going to
 *          retrieve for us the particular user's inventory from the database and give us a skill
 *          back as a skill.
 *
 *      OVERLOADED TWO:
 *          PARAMETERS: Integer index
 *          Given the value of a particular index we will return a particular ID that is related
 *          to that index.
 *
 *
 *  2: ADD:
 *      This is going to be the method that will allow us to add a skillz to the inventory list.
 *      Think about populating an inventory, is it not absolutely maddening to imagine
 *      having an empty inventory...? No...? No...? Just me?
 *      FINE!?
 *      BUT WE WILL LET USERS POPULATE THEIR INVENTORY. Because obviously if they have nothing
 *      in their inventory then they actually unfortunately have nothing to trade and then
 *      things are good.
 *
 *
 * 3: REMOVE:
 *     This is going to be the method that will be used in order to remove a particular skillZ
 *     from the inventory that is related to a particualr user of our program. Upon removal
 *     we will ideally update the database to inform all parties of the fact that this has been
 *     permanently removed from the user's inventory.
 *
 *
 * 4: SIZE:
 *     Suppose we want to know the size of a user's inventory. Maybe the user has one skill,
 *     maybe the user has 0 skills and therefore is on our app to.... mooch? I dunno. Maybe
 *     they have a billion skills and are stroking their ego and walking around using our
 *     application going "Ooh look at me, I am so skilled and your mother smells of elderberries!"
 *     Either way, upon invoking this method we will return to the user the current size of the
 *     inventory for that particular user.
 *
 * 5: FINDBYNAME:
 *     Given users use our application, and that there are more than one user's... would it not
 *     be considered essential to find the various inventories of users by their name? Yes? No?
 *     Well this is going to resolve that particular problem, and so now we're going to actually
 *     have the database query the database and get all of these inventories by their name.
 *
 *
 * 6: FINDBYCATEGORY:
 *     So we have categories in our application that differentiate skills that a user may have,
 *     the categories are broad stroking categories that the users may or may not opt to use.
 *     Ideally though if we have Fred the baker offering to cook cat shaped cookies we will have
 *     the skill fall into the cookie category (for instance) opposed to falling into the pets
 *     category (in which we do questionable things with cats perchance?).
 *
 *     Point being we select a category, send it into the database and query the database for all
 *     of the results that are related to this query, upon obtaining this value we've now obtained
 *     a full list of all of the things from the query that the application can now fully utilize
 *     with ease.
 *
 *
 * 7: ORDERBYNAME:
 *     Suppose we have a massive database query result and it's just... a henious massive beast
 *     that is present in this person's inventory. Let's say Igor the burly bearded man has
 *     like 10,000,000 skills (yeah, he's got dat) and then we want to somehow get through this
 *     list and find his ability to chop wood (because we're going to assume burly bearded men
 *     are all going to cut wood and wear plaid for whatever reason) and then we will have from
 *     this result the ability to scroll through the result alphabetically and then give to the
 *     application itself this result. Allowing the user on the other end of the application
 *     (As in the user using the app and choosing this option) to actually have something tangible
 *     and useful to read that they can properly interact with opposed to a hodge-podge mess of
 *     just.. the stuff of nightmares.
 *
 * 8: ORDERBYCATEGORY:
 *     Suppose now we want to ask Igor the burly bearded man to give us all of his skills for pets,
 *     lets say he is like a princess and has all the woodland creatures flock to him (including
 *     kittens)... his list of 10,000,000 skills is obviously oppressive and now we have the problem
 *     of wanting to see the pet skills.
 *
 *     So what do we do? The answer is that we take all of the categories that our application
 *     offers and now we arrange the results that the user on the other ends sees by these category
 *     groupings! TADA! BEAUTIFUL! ...Right? Right! Confidence, that is right!
 *
 *
 * 9: CLONESKILLZ:
 *     We're in the business of trading skills. Might our application need sometimes the ability
 *     to clone a list of skills? Probably, and so this is the means to which we will achieve that
 *     particular end! HORAAAY! Right!? RIGHT! So we're going to iterate throughout the list
 *     we want to copy and then place all of the items, item by item O(n) time and then we will
 *     stuff these items into a new list that we can utilize throughout the application.
 *
 *     Much fun, much chaos, much order. Somehow both.
