/**~~DESCRIPTION:
 * We want an android framework that will support the ability for the user to interact
 * with our application in a very logical and easy way. So we're going to create an activity
 * that is associated with just the activities with the user. This activity is going to be
 * associated purely with the entire search activity process that the user will need to interact
 * with through our application.
 *
 * ~~ACCESS:
 * This may seem redundant but for formatting purposes... this is a "public" class, meaning that
 * we can have this class actually be accessed technically anywhere in the application that
 * calls it. But since this is an activity it may seem a bit strange to refer to instantiating
 * an instance of the "EditTradeActivity" object.
 *
 * Instead what is happening is that we are having this activity be called by the onCreate() method
 * as is traditionally done in the android studio framework for android applications. In this
 * instance we're going to create this activity and then we'll have an onstart() method following
 * this which is going to make it so that we have this activate a cascade of events that are all
 * interelated with the main primary goal of allowing us to have a screen where we search the
 * actual screen of activities.
 *
 *~~CONSTRUCTOR:
 * Upon calling the method onCreate() for this activity the android studio framework will
 * cause the android application to create an instance of this actvity and display it to the user.
 *
 * ~~ATTRIBUTES/METHODS:
 * 1: SKILLS:
 *     We have a ton of skills involved in our application that are assocaited with every and
 *     any potential user. We're just going to store here in the activity a skill. Considering
 *     how our application is based around these skills, it is rather critical that we have
 *     a way of actually displaying this and letting the user actually do this.
 *
 * 2: USERS:
 *     Is it not essential to keep track of the users? Well it is! So we're going to maintain
 *     an attribute of the users that is going to actually have the users that are involved
 *     within this current search!
 *
 *
 *~~ MISC METHODS:
 * 1: REFINESEARCH:
 *     Suppose we want to refine a search, this method will be invoked when the user interacts
 *     with the UI with the intention to modify the search and then we have the user enter
 *     a string of what they want to search and this method will be invoked and search through
 *     all of the things and then update all views.
 *
 *
 * 2: CHANGECATEGORY:
 *     This will allow the user to actually be able to choose a particular category that they are
 *     interesting in viewing through the user interface, following this the app will go through
 *     a cascade of statements here that will allow the user to modify all of the search in order
 *     to be tailored to something that is directly related to the category of the user's
 *     choosing!
 *
 * 3: POPULATESEARCHRESULTS:
 *     Is it not critical to actually populate a pool of search results? Yes? YES IT IS!
 *     Without a pool of results for a user TO be sorted there is NO point in having a search screen
 *     and so when this activity is called and presenting the UI to the user we will actually
 *     be giving the UUI the method to actually populate the application being shown through
 *     the UI to the user through this particular method.
