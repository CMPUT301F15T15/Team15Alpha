/**~~DESCRIPTION:
 * We want an android framework that will support the ability for the user to interact
 * with our application in a very logical and easy way. So we're going to create an activity
 * that is associated with just the activities with the user. This activity is going to be
 * associated purely with the entire trade request process that the user will need to interact with
 * through our application.
 *
 * ~~ACCESS:
 * This may seem redundant but for formatting purposes... this is a "public" class, meaning that
 * we can have this class actually be accessed technically anywhere in the application that
 * calls it. But since this is an activity it may seem a bit strange to refer to instantiating
 * an instance of the "EditTradeActivity" object.
 *
 * Instead what is happening is that we are having this activity be called by the onCreate() method
 * as is traditionally done in the android studio framework for android applications. In this
 * instance we're going to create this activity and then we'll have an onstart() method following
 * this which is going to make it so that we have this activate a cascade of events that are all
 * interelated with the main primary goal of allowing us to have a screen where we edit the
 * trading activity!
 *
 *~~CONSTRUCTOR:
 * Upon calling the method onCreate() for this activity the android studio framework will
 * cause the android application to create an instance of this actvity and display it to the user.
 *
 * ~~ATTRIBUTES/METHODS:
 * 1: ACCEPTTRADE:
 *     This is going to be the method called when the user interacts with the UI where the user
 *     actually is going to accept a trade that is presented to them. When this is hit
 *     a series of steps will be activated in which the trade will actually be accepted by the user.
 *
 *
 *  2: DELETEREQUEST:
 *      When the user actually wants to DELETE a request they can interact with the UI and then
 *      this method will be called. This will outright remove the request of trading from the
 *      user's application permanently. Fabulous.
 *
 * 3: COUNTEROFFER:
 *     Suppose a user isn't happy with what they currently are seeing/offering for a particular
 *     trade in our application, interacting with the UI will allow us to have a counteroffer
 *     method called (this method) that will allow the user to edit their trade agreement in
 *     the application in a glorious and beautiful fashion!
 *     MAJESTIC! AS! HECK!
 *
 * 4: SETTRADEDETAILS:
 *     When a user interacts with their application, it is stupidly essential to give the user
 *     the DETAILS of a particular trade that they are performing on. This method is called when
 *     the user interacts with the UI in a fashion that allows the user to view the details
 *     of a given trade.
 *
 *
 * 5: SETTRADENOTES:
 *     This is going to obtain the trade notes from the user and then will present them to the
 *     user of the application once the application framework is prompted to actually go
 *     through these series of steps!
 *
 *
 * 6: SETTRADETITLE:
 *     This is going to be more "UI related" but it also has the effect that we now have some
 *     sort of special unique identifier (aside from ID) that the user can relate to when they are
 *     dealing with the entire trade process. This gives the user that power to set the
 *     title of the trade! GLORIOUS!
