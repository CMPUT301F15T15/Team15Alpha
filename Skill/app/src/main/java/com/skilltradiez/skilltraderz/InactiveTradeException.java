/**~~DESCRIPTION:
 * In this application we can have many sorts of exceptions,
 * it is our goal to handle these exceptions in the best way possible. And so we personally
 * went out of our own ways to make a specific exception for inactive trades!
 * This will act as a generalized exception for now and allows us the ability to personalize
 * our particular ways of tackling the problems of an inactive trade! :)
