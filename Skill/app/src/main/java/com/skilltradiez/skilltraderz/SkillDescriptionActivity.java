/**~~DESCRIPTION:
 * We want an android framework that will support the ability for the user to interact
 * with our application in a very logical and easy way. So we're going to create an activity
 * that is associated with just the activities with the user. This activity is going to be
 * associated purely with the entire skill description process that the user will need to interact
 * with through our application.
 *
 * ~~ACCESS:
 * This may seem redundant but for formatting purposes... this is a "public" class, meaning that
 * we can have this class actually be accessed technically anywhere in the application that
 * calls it. But since this is an activity it may seem a bit strange to refer to instantiating
 * an instance of the "EditTradeActivity" object.
 *
 * Instead what is happening is that we are having this activity be called by the onCreate() method
 * as is traditionally done in the android studio framework for android applications. In this
 * instance we're going to create this activity and then we'll have an onstart() method following
 * this which is going to make it so that we have this activate a cascade of events that are all
 * interelated with the main primary goal of allowing us to have a screen where we edit the
 * trading activity!
 *
 *~~CONSTRUCTOR:
 * Upon calling the method onCreate() for this activity the android studio framework will
 * cause the android application to create an instance of this actvity and display it to the user.
 *
 * ~~ATTRIBUTES/METHODS:
 * 1: SETSKILLTITLE:
 *     This is more of a UI element but this will allow us to actually set the value of the title
 *     for this particular skill description for the particular application.
 * 2: SETSKILLDESCRIPTION:
 *     Suppose we want to have the user modify the skill description, through the UI this
 *     method will be invoked that will allow the user to actually set their skill description
 *     for the rest of the application.
 *
 * 3: ADDREMOVESKILL:
 *     This is going to be the entire process of adding or removing a skill from a skill description
 *     when we actually have the user interact with the UI to call this method that will
 *     allow them to add or remove a damn skill.
