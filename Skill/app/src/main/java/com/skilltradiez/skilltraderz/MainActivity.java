/**~~DESCRIPTION:
 * We want an android framework that will support the ability for the user to interact
 * with our application in a very logical and easy way. So we're going to create an activity
 * that is associated with just the activities with the user. This activity is going to be
 * associated purely with the entire skill description process that the user will need to interact
 * with through our application.
 *
 * ~~ACCESS:
 * This may seem redundant but for formatting purposes... this is a "public" class, meaning that
 * we can have this class actually be accessed technically anywhere in the application that
 * calls it. But since this is an activity it may seem a bit strange to refer to instantiating
 * an instance of the "EditTradeActivity" object.
 *
 * Instead what is happening is that we are having this activity be called by the onCreate() method
 * as is traditionally done in the android studio framework for android applications. In this
 * instance we're going to create this activity and then we'll have an onstart() method following
 * this which is going to make it so that we have this activate a cascade of events that are all
 * interelated with the main primary goal of allowing us to have a screen where we edit the
 * trading activity!
 *
 *~~CONSTRUCTOR:
 * Upon calling the method onCreate() for this activity the android studio framework will
 * cause the android application to create an instance of this actvity and display it to the user.
 *
 * ~~ATTRIBUTES/METHODS:
 * 1: MAKESEARCHTHREAD:
 *     This is going to grant the user the ability to make a search thread for searching
 *     through various things through our application such as profiles, friends, skills,
 *     inventories.
 *
 * 2: NEWUSER:
 *     This is going to be how we actually add a new user to our application and our application
 *     database. Without this UI element and method tied to the UI we would no doubt have
 *     a complete and utter failure of this application.
 *
 *
 * 3: BEGINALLSEARCH:
 *     This is going to be how we're going to actually begin all of the potential searches
 *     within this application. We let it begin a potential search options from this UI option
 *     which invokes this UI method.
 *
 * 4: BEGINREFINEDSEARCH:
 *     Suppose the user of the application wants a furhter refined search with more speficic options
 *     that are tied to the search process. This is going to be the method called and then we will
 *     provide all of the search options to the various users.
 *
 * 5: SHOWPROFILE
 *     This is going to be the method called when the user clicks on the UI where we will
 *     successfully have all of the profile of what they clicked on through this method.
 *
 * 6: CREATENEWSKILL:
 *     Suppose we have the user wanting to create a new skill for our application. This is going
 *     to be the method that is called through the UI when the UI is clicked that will prompt
 *     for the entire cascade of what is going to be produced through the entire cascaded process.
