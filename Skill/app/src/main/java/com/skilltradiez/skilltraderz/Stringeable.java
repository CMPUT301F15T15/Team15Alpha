/**
 * DESCRIPTION: This class is going to be dedicated to making it so that we have more functionality
 * on the notification class. This is a subclass of the notification class that allows us to have
 * methods to get the name, descrption or image.
 *
 * Realize though that image is going to be an int, despite this being called stringable. The
 * other two are, as makes sense, strings.
