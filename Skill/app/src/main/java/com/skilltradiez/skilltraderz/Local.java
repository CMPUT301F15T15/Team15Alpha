/**~~DESCRIPTION:
 * In our application it is going to be essential for local saves to be incorporated through
 * some sort of mecahnsm, this class, the local class is going to be what we're actually
 * going to utilize in order to achieve this end.
 *
 * ~~ACCESS:
 * This is public meaning any part of this application can indeed somehow create instantiations
 * of this object and that any part of the application can also use any methods that are
 * associated with any of these objects at whim. Allowing flexibility and a lot of potential
 * areas of use! GLORIOUS! :)
 *
 * ~~CONSTRUCTOR:
 * This class is going to only have a single constructor that will take into itself no params
 * but when it is instantiated it will attempt to create a save_object (attribute) which is
 * going to be an attempted readfrom file. If this fails then we throw an exception mindyou!
 * SAFTEY FIRST! :D
 *
 * ~~ATTRIBUTES/METHODS:
 *
 * 1: SAVE_OBJECT:
 *     This is going to be the attribute associated with what the constructor read from the file
 *     and this is going to allow easy and effecient caching of all of the file that we desire
 *     to know about and interact with.
 *
 *
 * 2: SAVE_FILE:
 *     This is something set by us to set a path of where exactly we're going to be putting
 *     together all of this locally saved data once we're at the point of saving the things.
 *     This is hard coded.
 *
 * ~~MISC METHODS:
 *     I'm going to isolate the methods here for clarity's sake, please forgive me for breaking
 *     the regular formatting of comments.
 *
 * 1: SAVETOFILE:
 *     THIS IS AN OVERLOADED METHOD! OVERLOADED METHOD! TWO VERIONS!
 *
 *     OVERLOAD 1:
 *     PARAMETERS: NONE (NONE! NO PARAMETERS HERE!)
 *     When this method is called we're going to do the very critical and obviously essential
 *     thing of saving the current file into the local device. This when called will allow us to
 *     do this process. SUPER CRITICAL. No point to any of this without this method.
 *
 *     OVERLOAD 2:
 *     PARAMETERS: User me, List<User> friends, List<Skill> skillz List<Trade> trades,
 *                   List<Notification> notifications
 *     This is going to be our initial save to the storage on the device, we therefore
 *     need to specify and send a whole bunch of parameters into the local device's storage, this
 *     will allow the application to actually know what the heck it is putting into the local
 *     storage on the device.
 *
 *
 *
 * 2: GETLOCALDATA:
 *     This is going to return the ENTIRE saved object from the local device's storage and
 *     inform the application of all of it as a LocalPersistentObject object.
 *
 * 3: READFROMFILE:
 *     When we actually are going to take the storage of the application we're going to actually
 *     be looking at the information that is currently stored within the application and then
 *     we'll see what is going on through this method and then we'll see through this all
 *     being returned as a LocalPersistentObject.
 *
