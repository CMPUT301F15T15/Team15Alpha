/**~~DESCRIPTION:
 * So our program is core on trades, and profiles and users. Users have profiles and there is a
 * very clear way to make their profiles and their offers (of skills) more lucrative, exciting,
 * cool and overall appleaing...
 *
 * Colorful images! We're going to actually grant the user the ability to actually go through
 * their application and select an image (or upload a new one!) where they will be making an
 * image class.
 *
 * ~~ACCESS:
 * This is a public class and can be instantiated anywhere by any class anywhere in the application
 *
 * ~~CONSTRUCTORS:
 * This class has a constructor associated with itself where it takes in a string of a particular
 * file to open and then will process this string of the file and maintain the image in itself.
 * Glorious.
 *
 * ~~ATTRIBUTES/METHODS:
 *     This class has no attributes or methods associated with it aside from the constructor.
