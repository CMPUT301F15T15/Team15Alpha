####Project Deliverables 
Project Part 4 - Nov 6, 2015

Addressing Feedback From Part 3:
  1. All feedback was positive (GREAT!)

================================Still Needs To Be Changed==================================
Part 4 requirements:
   1. Code Base of Prototype: have a code base:https://github.com/CMPUT301F15T15/Team15Alpha
   2. , demonstrate something tangible (video)
   3. Code Documentation: brief introductory comment for each source file (Cole was doing it right), 
                          Javadoc interface documentation for your use cases and basic command classes and their public                                methods (at least). Deliver the compiled Javadoc documentation to your source repository.
   4. Test Cases: Junit tests for all use cases (complete implementation not yet necessary) (oops)
   5. Object-Oriented Design: update UML (Smells MVC-ish?) (done for now?)
   6. Release Planning: plan use case/stories for part 5 (done?)
   7. Reuse Statement: third party libraries(Should be in wiki)
